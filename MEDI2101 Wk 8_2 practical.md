### What is an autonomic function test?
####

Any test that interrogates autonomic function for the purposes of diagnosing dysfunction.

**Types of tests include (but not limited to):**
-   Valsalva maneuvre
-   0.1 Hz breathing (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia)
-   head-up tilt test
-   active stand challenge
-   isometric hand-grip test

**Measurement devices:** Autonomic function tests are usually done using a lead II ECG and standard oscillometric automatic blood pressure cuff.

Most tests measure both the heart rate and blood pressure **response** to a **challenge** i.e. how heart rate and blood pressure respond to a perturbation to the cardiovascular and respiratory system.

### Valsalva maneuvre
####

<span style="color:red">**Do not attempt this test if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia.**</span>

1. Find your radial pulse and monitor your pulse. (This test is usually done with the nose clamped shut. But seeing as you have your finger on your pulse, you won't be doing that.)

2. Close your mouth.

3. Take a deep breath in then try to forcefully exhale (like you are blowing up a balloon) but keeping your mouth closed - that is, NOT letting air pass your lips.

4. Take note of any changes in your pulse rate.

5. Continue for roughly 10 to 15 seconds, then resume normal breathing.

### Introducing another device
#### The Peñáz* technique of blood pressure measurement

<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> Tracks blood pressure (and pulse rate) continuously.</li>
    <li> Records the blood pressure waveform not just systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Having the waveform allows for estimation of other parameters such as stroke volume and total peripheral resistance.</li>
</ul>
</span>
<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> Not particularly accurate at measuring blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Even worse at estimating stroke volume.</li>
    <li> Hard to estimate accuracy of total peripheral resistance calculation.</li>
</ul>

### Active stand challenge
####

<span style="color:red">**Do not attempt this test if you often feel dizzy or faint upon standing.**</span>

What you will need:
- automatic blood pressure machine if available, or
  - stopwatch (e.g. on phone) to measure your pulse rate
- pen and paper, or access to a computer with this spreadsheet <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT>

The challenge:
1. Lay down for 5 minutes. *Once each minute*, note your blood pressure and heart rate.
2. After 5 minutes, press the "start" button on your blood pressure device, then stand up.
3. Immediately on standing, measure heart rate over the first 10 seconds.
4. Remain standing. *On each minute following standing up*, record the heart rate and blood pressure.
5. Stop after 5 minutes of standing.
6. Enter your data in the spreadsheet: <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT>
