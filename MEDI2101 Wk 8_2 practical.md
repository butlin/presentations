### Active stand challenge
####

**Do not volunteer to be a participant in this study if you often have dizzy spells, or if you often feel light-headed when standing up.**

--
### Active stand challenge
#### Set up

1. Choose a volunteer*.
2. Enter into the spreadsheet their:
   1. age
   2. sex
   3. height
   4. weight
3. Have them lay down on the bed.
4. Place a blood pressure cuff on their non-dominant arm.
5. Fit them with the respiratory belt.
6. Start the recording software. Check quality of all signals. Correct instrumentation if the signals are not good.

### Active stand challenge
#### Supine period

8. With the volunteer supine, repeat each minute over 5 minutes:
   1. At the 30 second point of each minute, start the blood pressure monitor. Enter the value of blood pressure and pulse rate value in the spreadsheet ( <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT> ).
   2. At the 30 second point of each minute, note the respiratory rate and enter that in the spreadsheet.
   <!-- 3. At the 30 second point of each minute, note the heart rate as calculated from the ECG and enter that in the spreadsheet. -->

### Active stand challenge
#### Active stand period (Keep the data acquisition system recording.)

9. <b>Whilst the participant is still laying down on the bed</b>, start the blood pressure monitor.
10. When the reading on the pressure value on the screen rises to about 120 mmHg, have the volunteer move quickly to a standing position and then <b>stay very still</b>.
11. Enter the first blood pressure and pulse rate reading into the spreadsheet ( <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT> ).
<!-- 12. Take an ECG calculated heart rate value in the first 30 seconds of standing. Enter it into the spreadsheet. -->
12. Take a respiratory rate value in the first 30 seconds of standing. Enter it into the spreadsheet.
13. Repeat blood pressure (and pulse rate) and respiratory rate measurements each minute for 5 minutes of standing.

### Active stand challenge
#### Repeat

Repeat for at least one other volunteer in your group. Also enter that data into the spreadsheet.

### Introducing another device
#### The Pe침치z* technique of blood pressure measurement

<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> Tracks blood pressure (and pulse rate) continuously.</li>
    <li> Records the blood pressure waveform not just systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Having the waveform allows for estimation of other parameters such as stroke volume and total peripheral resistance.</li>
</ul>
</span>
<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> Not particularly accurate at measuring blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Even worse at estimating stroke volume.</li>
    <li> Hard to estimate accuracy of total peripheral resistance calculation.</li>
</ul>
</span>
