### Data collection for Assessment Task 3b
#### (Not needed for Assessment Task 3a)

1. On your volunteer, connect:
   - Respiratory belt
   - Blood pressure cuff
   - SpO<sub>2</sub> monitor
2. Get the volunteer's maximum hand-grip strength.<br>(Squeeze the hand-grip as hard as you can!).
3. Take heart rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory rate readings every minute (enter data into spreadsheet) during:
   1. 5 minutes of seated rest.
   2. 5 minutes of isometric hand-grip (participant squeezes hand-grip to 15% of maximum).
   3. 2 minutes of seated rest (recovery).

Repeat in as many willing volunteers as you can complete in your time today.

Discuss amongst your group what might be happening physiologically.<br>Any questions? Ask the staff.
