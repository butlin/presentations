### Data collection for Assessment Task 3b

- <a href="https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT">Spreadsheet where you will enter today's data.</a>

After all practical classes have completed the data collection, the unit convener will conduct a statistical analysis of the data.

That analysis will be provided to you so that you can complete Assessment Task 3b.

<!-- ### Data collection for Assessment Task 3b
#### (Not needed for Assessment Task 3a)

1. On your volunteer, connect:
   - Respiratory belt
   - Blood pressure cuff
   - SpO<sub>2</sub> monitor
2. Get the volunteer's maximum hand-grip strength.<br>(Squeeze the hand-grip as hard as you can!).
3. Take heart rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory rate readings every minute (enter data into spreadsheet) during:
   1. 5 minutes of seated rest.
   2. 5 minutes of isometric hand-grip (participant squeezes hand-grip to 15% of maximum).
   3. 2 minutes of seated rest (recovery).

Repeat in as many willing volunteers as you can complete in your time today.

Discuss amongst your group what might be happening physiologically.<br>Any questions? Ask the staff.-->

### Data collection for Assessment Task 3b
#### (Not needed for Assessment Task 3a)

1. On your volunteer connect:
   - Respiratory belt
   - Blood pressure cuff
   - SpO<sub>2</sub> monitor
2. Enter into <a href="https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT">the spreadsheet</a> the volunteer's:
   - age and sex,
   - and if the volunteer is willing, their gender, height, weight.
1. Have the volunteer lay down for 7 minutes. In each minute of the 3rd to 5th minute of supine rest, note in <a href="https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT">the spreadsheet</a>:
   - heart rate
   - systolic blood pressure
   - diastolic blood pressure
   - SpO<sub>2</sub>
   - respiratory rate (make sure you have a good respiratory belt signal, and the respiratory rate makes sense)
2. Start the blood pressure cuff then have the volunteer stand up <b>smoothly and quickly then stand very still</b>. In each minute, record the same variables as in step 3.<br>Repeat for 3 minutes of standing.
