2022 AT3 - Active stand challenge
--
### Active stand challenge
####

**Do not volunteer to be a participant in this study if you often have dizzy spells, or if you often feel light-headed when standing up.**

--
### Active stand challenge
#### Set up

1. Choose a volunteer*.
2. Enter into the spreadsheet their:
   1. age
   2. sex
   3. height
   4. weight
3. Have them lay down on the bed.
4. Place a blood pressure cuff on their non-dominant arm.
5. Fit them with the respiratory belt.
6. Start the recording software. Check quality of all signals. Correct instrumentation if the signals are not good.

### Active stand challenge
#### Supine period

8. With the volunteer supine, repeat each minute over 5 minutes:
   1. At the 30 second point of each minute, start the blood pressure monitor. Enter the value of blood pressure and pulse rate value in the spreadsheet ( <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT> ).
   2. At the 30 second point of each minute, note the respiratory rate and enter that in the spreadsheet.

### Active stand challenge
#### Active stand period (Keep the data acquisition system recording.)

9. <b>Whilst the participant is still laying down on the bed</b>, start the blood pressure monitor.
10. When the reading on the pressure value on the screen rises to about 120 mmHg, have the volunteer move quickly to a standing position and then <b>stay very still</b>.
11. Enter the first blood pressure and pulse rate reading into the spreadsheet ( <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT> ).
12. Take a respiratory rate value in the first 30 seconds of standing. Enter it into the spreadsheet.
13. Repeat blood pressure (and pulse rate) and respiratory rate measurements each minute for 5 minutes of standing.

--
### Active stand challenge
#### Repeat

Repeat for at least one other volunteer in your group. Also enter that data into the spreadsheet.

--
### What now for Assessment Task 3, Part 2?
####

The unit convenor will be compiling the data across **all** the practical classes, and providing that data summary to you.

You will be able to write up the Discussion section of the manuscript based on that data summary.

Do not use the individual data from your group, or this practical today.

### Introducing another device
#### The Peñáz* technique of blood pressure measurement

<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Strengths:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> Tracks blood pressure (and pulse rate) continuously.</li>
    <li> Records the blood pressure waveform not just systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Having the waveform allows for estimation of other parameters such as stroke volume and total peripheral resistance.</li>
</ul>
</span>
<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> Not particularly accurate at measuring blood pressure.</li>
    <li> Even worse at estimating stroke volume.</li>
    <li> Hard to estimate accuracy of total peripheral resistance calculation.</li>
</ul>
</span>
