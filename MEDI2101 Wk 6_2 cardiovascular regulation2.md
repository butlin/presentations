## LO2.3.5 Outline the key steps of the chemoreceptor reflex, including the: stimulus, sensors, changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs, the arteriolar and myocardial targets, and the local and systemic changes.

### Chemoreceptor reflex
####
<ul>
<li> chemoreceptors monitor changes in blood concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions</li>
<li> chemoreceptors are located in the carotid bodies and the aortic arch</li>
<li> they sense</li>
<ul>
        <li> <b>hypoxia</b> lowered blood oxygen availability</li>
        <li> <b>acidosis</b> increased hydrogen ion concentration in blood</li>
        <li> <b>hypercapnia</b> excess carbon dioxide in blood</li>
</ul>
<li> signals to the central nervous system (both the respiratory and cardiovascular centres).</li>
<li> in addition to respiratory changes, sympathetic and parasympathetic output alters cardiac contractility and heart rate (cardiac output), and vasoconstriction (total peripheral resistance).</li>
</ul>

<p class="fragment">We don't need any more information as we have covered chemoreceptors in Week 3, and the sympathetic and parasympathetic effect of the heart and blood vessels in the first lecture today.</p>

### Cerebral ischaemia
#### Causes of cerebral ischaemia

- <b>Local causes</b> for example, stroke by vascular occlusion.
- <b>Systemic causes</b> for example, blood loss.
- <b>Cushing reflex</b> increased intracranial pressure above brain arterial blood pressure

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Cerebral ischaemia
#### Cushing reflex

If the intracranial pressure reaches or exceeds the critical closing pressure of the intracranial vasculature (approximately 0 mmHg transmural pressure), blood supply to the brain will be cut.

<blockquote>
<b>Cushing reaction (or reflex)</b>
<p>The blocking of blood flow (by increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid) results in a reaction that drives arterial pressure higher, above the level of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, to restore blood flow to the brain.</p>
</blockquote

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Cerebral ischaemia
#### Response to cerebral ischaemia

Cerebral ischaemia causes a unique response whereby the vasomotor cortex senses and responds directly to the ischaemic event.

Mechanisms:
- Vasoconstrictor and cardioaccelerator neurons in the vasomotor center in the lower brainstem respond directly to the ischemia.
- Believed to be activated by high CO<sub>2</sub> in the region when blood is unable to carry the waste product away from the region.
- Possible other factors are involved such as lactic acid and other acidic substances in the vasomotor center.

## LO2.3.7 Understand how changes in blood volume alter systemic arterial blood pressure

### Blood volume and systemic arterial blood pressure
#### 

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{systemic\~arterial\~blood\~pressure} \propto \mathrm{blood\~volume}
\end{equation}

If total blood volume is increased, blood pressure will increase.

<p class="fragment">This is not a rapid method to alter blood pressure, as it takes a longer period of time to alter blood volume (as opposed to altering venous return, or chemosensor and baroreceptor feedback).</p>

## LO2.3.8 Recognise that there is hormonal control of blood pressure.

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Hormonal control of blood pressure
#### Norepinephrine and epinephrine (noradrenaline and adrenaline)

<b>Vasoconstrictor: Norepinephrine</b>

Vasoconstrictor nerve terminals release predominantly norephinephrine, a potent vasoconstrictor acting on alpha adrenergic receptors of vascular smooth muscle.



--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Hormonal control of blood pressure
#### Norepinephrine and epinephrine (noradrenaline and adrenaline)

<b>The adrenal medullae</b>
<ul>
  <li> sympathetic nerves also terminate in the adrenal medullae</li>
  <li> stimulation causes secretion of both epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood stream</li>
  <li> therefore, these potent vasoconstrictors act systemically on most organs*</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation">* Epinephrine can cause vasodilation because it also has a beta-adrenergic receptor stimulatory effect, which dilates rather than constricts certain vessels.<br>It has only a weak constriction effect on blood vessels of skeletal muscles.</p>

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Hormonal control of blood pressure
#### Antidiruetic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin

Produced by the hypothalamus (in the brain), transported to the pituitary gland where it is released into the blood.

Induced by:
<ul>
<li> <b>hypovolemia</b> decreased blood volume caused by, for example, dehydration. Sensed by the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors and communicated to the hypothalamus.</li>
<li> <b>hypovolemia</b> sensed by hypothalamic osmoreceptors in response to high extracellular osmolarity.</li>
<li> <b>hypotension</b> sensed by the baroreceptors.</li>
<li> <b>angiotensin II</b> increased in circulating blood.</li>
</ul>
  
<span class="fragment">
<p> Increases reabsorption of water from renal tubules, increasing blood volume, increasing extracellular fluid and decreasing extracellular osmolarity.</p>

#### Feedback loops - overshoot and undershoot (oscillations)
  
<blockquote>
Baroreflex, chemoreceptors, and the Cushing reflex are closed-loop feedback systems. This means that they change what they are sensing, thus all are susceptible to over/under shoot in blood pressure during regulation of blood pressure and flow.
</blockquote>

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Bringing it all together
#### Feedback loops - overshoot and undershoot (oscillations)

**Baroreflex associated blood pressure oscillations**

- **cause** lag between detection of blood pressure change and implementation of response results in a slow over/under shoot in baroreflex response to pressure falls/rises.
- **frequency** have a similar frequency response (and possibly are the cause of) "Mayer waves", that rise and fall at a frequency of approximately 0.1 to 0.15 Hz (an oscillation every 6 to 10 seconds).

<span class="fragment">
<p><b>Chemoreceptor associated blood pressure oscillations</b></p>
<ul>
<li> <b>cause</b> Similar over/under shoot response as described in baroreflex above.</b>
<li> <b>when</b> stronger at lower blood pressures, where the baroreflex has a lesser effect.</b>
</ul>

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
### Bringing it all together
#### Feedback loops - overshoot and undershoot (oscillations)

**Blood pressure oscillations caused by the Cushing reflex**

When the Cushing reflex is activated and blood flow is restored to the brain, the reflex is lessened causing a decrease in blood pressure to a point near where blood flow to the brain again stops, causing an increase in the Cushing reflex, and an increase in blood pressure.

To alter systemic arterial blood pressure (here mean arterial pressure, MAP), we must change one or more of:

$\begin{align}
\mathrm{MAP} & = \mathrm{CO} \times \mathrm{TPR}\\\\
  & = \mathrm{SV} \times \mathrm{HR} \times \mathrm{TPR}

Venous return mechanisms (where venous return is altered, e.g. by sympathetic stimulation of the venous smooth muscle; skeletal muscle pump; respiratory pump;). For increased venous return (opposite for decreased venous return):

      <li> <b>Frank-Starling law of the heart:</b> positive feedback, increases stroke volume through increased cardiac contractility</li>
      <li> <b>Bainbridge reflex:</b> positive feedback, increases stroke volume (through cardiac contractility) and heart rate.</li>

There are many receptors throughout the body that signal to the central nervous system and result in changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow. This table is a list (that is not exhaustive) of some of those things that alter sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Some of these will be familiar from the respiratory regulation material (Week 3).
