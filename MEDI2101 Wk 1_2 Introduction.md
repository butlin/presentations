<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Posting questions</h4>

<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Posting questions</h4>
<p>Questions are anonymous to your peers.</p>
<p>It is not <em>completely</em> anonymous - teaching staff can go into the system to find out who
  posted what.</p>
<p>Impolite posting will not be tolerated.</p>

--
<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Why Echo360? (and not Zoom)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Formal Q&A system</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Including possibility to answer questions following the lecture that the lecturer did not answer during the lecture.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Feedback to unit convenor on how many people are using the live or catchup versions of the lecture.</li>
  <li> Embraces accessibility with automatic generation of a text transcript of the lecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
  <li>I can't see you all!</li>
  <li>No green screen effect (apologies for the drab background)</li>
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Zoom will be used for anatomy classes to facilitate the interactive "tutorial style" approach to those classes.</p>

### Unit description and outcomes
####

--
<h3>Unit description</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>This unit introduces integrated learning of the <b>anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular and respiratory system</b>.</p>
<p>It focuses on: the <b>mechanisms that maintain homeostasis</b> in these coordinated systems including acid-base balance; a working knowledge of the <b>dynamic cardiovascular and respiratory responses to physical challenges</b>; the ability to relate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to their underlying pathophysiological pathways.</p>
<p> You will also critically <b>consider scientific and medical evidence</b> in cardiovascular and respiratory contexts to inform hypothesis generation, discussion and individual decision-making.</p>

--

<h3>Unit outcomes</h3>
<h4></h4>
<ul>
<li> Describe the <b>histological and anatomical structures</b> of the cardiovascular and
  respiratory systems.</li>
<li> Explain the <b>functions of the cardiovascular and respiratory system</b>, as well as the
  <b>mechanisms that maintain homeostasis</b> in these coordinated systems.
</li>
<li> Relate knowledge of the structure and function of the cardiovascular and respiratory system
  to <b>disease processes</b>.</li>
<li> Use biomedical literature and the <b>method of scientific enquiry</b> to outline the
  cardiovascular and respiratory response to physical challenges.</li>
<li> Effectively participate in scheduled activities and in peer teams, seeking and reflecting
  on feedback to improve individual and group performance.</li>
</ul>

### Assessment tasks
####

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment task 1: Formative quiz (0%). Due week 3.</h4>
<p>On-line in iLearn.</p>
<p>Reviews some of the respiratory component (physiology and anatomy) of MEDI2101.</p>
<p>0% assessment task, but <b>compulsory to complete to pass the unit.</b></p>
<p>Feedback:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Feedback is provided with each question.</li>
  <li> The mark will also provide you feedback on whether you are tracking well so far.</li>
</ul>

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment Task 2: Anatomy test (25%). During lecture, week 7.</h4>
<ul>
  <li> On-line anatomy quiz.</li>
  <li> Created by Dr Mirjana Strkalj</li>
  <li> It is likely to be hard.</li>
</ul>

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment Task 3: Manuscript (35%) Due week 8 and 12</h4>
<p>Three parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Figure for an introduction</b> Flow diagram explaining your hypothesis for what will
    happen in the experiment (Due week 8).
  <li> <b>Conducting experiment</b> Hopefully in class during physiological measurement practical.
    If not, a video demonstration will be provided and a data set and results placed on iLearn.
  <li> <b>Discussion</b> Discussion of results, limitations, and conclusion. (Due week 12)
</ol>

<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment Task 4: Exam (40%). Held during exam period.</h4>
<p>The final exam was able to be held on campus last year and the same is planned for this year as
  well.</p>
<p>However, if restrictions do not allow for an on-campus exam, an on-line equivalent will be put in
  place</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Week 13 has been left open as a review week.</p>

<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Accessibility support</h4>
<p>If you are someone with an on-going health condition, disability and/or are a carer of a person with a disability, please consider contacting Accessibility Support and Services early during session to put in an Individual Education Access Plan for MEDI2101.</p>
<p>You are welcome to contact me (you do not need to provide details) so that I can follow up with Accessibility Support to make sure they have put in place your Individual Education Access Plan in MEDI2101.</p>
