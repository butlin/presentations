<ul>
  <li>Recognition that the university journey can have difficulties with causes <b>both internal and external</b> to the university.</li>
  <li>+ demands are different now (cost of living, university fees, world “temperament”).</li>
  <li>+ world temperament is not great (unsettled after/during COVID-19 impact; wars; climate change; ...)
  <li>+ this is a second year unit that many will be sitting in their first year.</li>
</ul>

**Please contact Mark Butlin early if you are having difficulties, so that we can help you succeed in this unit.**

### Live lectures in Echo360
#### Taking notes
<img src="images/Echo360TakingNotes.png">

<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Posting questions</h4>
<img src="images/Echo360PostingQuestions.png">

<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Posting questions</h4>
<p>Questions are anonymous to your peers.</p>
<p>It is not <em>completely</em> anonymous - teaching staff can go into the system to find out who
  posted what.</p>
<p>Impolite posting will not be tolerated.</p>

<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Why Echo360? (and not Zoom)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Formal Q&A system</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Including possibility to answer questions following the lecture that the lecturer did not answer during the lecture.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Feedback to unit convenor on how many people are using the live or catchup versions of the lecture.</li>
  <li> Embraces accessibility with automatic generation of a text transcript of the lecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
  <li>I can't see you all!</li>
  <li>No green screen effect (apologies for the drab background)</li>
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Zoom will be used for anatomy classes to facilitate the interactive "tutorial style" approach to those classes.</p>

<h3>Unit description and outcomes</h3>
<h4></h4>

<h3>Unit description</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>This unit introduces integrated learning of the <b>anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular and respiratory system</b>.</p>
<p>It focuses on: the <b>mechanisms that maintain homeostasis</b> in these coordinated systems including acid-base balance; a working knowledge of the <b>dynamic cardiovascular and respiratory responses to physical challenges</b>; the ability to relate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to their underlying pathophysiological pathways.</p>
<p> You will also critically <b>consider scientific and medical evidence</b> in cardiovascular and respiratory contexts to inform hypothesis generation, discussion and individual decision-making.</p>

<h3>Unit outcomes</h3>
<h4></h4>
<ul>
<li> Describe the <b>histological and anatomical structures</b> of the cardiovascular and
  respiratory systems.</li>
<li> Explain the <b>functions of the cardiovascular and respiratory system</b>, as well as the
  <b>mechanisms that maintain homeostasis</b> in these coordinated systems.
</li>
<li> Relate knowledge of the structure and function of the cardiovascular and respiratory system
  to <b>disease processes</b>.</li>
<li> Use biomedical literature and the <b>method of scientific enquiry</b> to outline the
  cardiovascular and respiratory response to physical challenges.</li>
<li> Effectively participate in scheduled activities and in peer teams, seeking and reflecting
  on feedback to improve individual and group performance.</li>
</ul>
