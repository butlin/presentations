<h3>Live lectures in Echo360</h3>
<h4>Why Echo360? (and not Zoom)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Formal Q&A system</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Including possibility to answer questions following the lecture that the lecturer did not answer during the lecture.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Feedback to unit convenor on how many people are using the live or catchup versions of the lecture.</li>
  <li> Embraces accessibility with automatic generation of a text transcript of the lecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
  <li>I can't see you all!</li>
  <li>No green screen effect (apologies for the drab background)</li>
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Zoom will be used for anatomy classes to facilitate the interactive "tutorial style" approach to those classes.</p> -->

### Unit description and outcomes
####

--
<h3>Unit description</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>This unit introduces integrated learning of the <b>anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular and respiratory system</b>.</p>
<p>It focuses on: the <b>mechanisms that maintain homeostasis</b> in these coordinated systems including acid-base balance; a working knowledge of the <b>dynamic cardiovascular and respiratory responses to physical challenges</b>; the ability to relate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to their underlying pathophysiological pathways.</p>
<p> You will also critically <b>consider scientific and medical evidence</b> in cardiovascular and respiratory contexts to inform hypothesis generation, discussion and individual decision-making.</p>

--

<h3>Unit outcomes</h3>
<h4></h4>
<ul>
<li> Describe the <b>histological and anatomical structures</b> of the cardiovascular and
  respiratory systems.</li>
<li> Explain the <b>functions of the cardiovascular and respiratory system</b>, as well as the
  <b>mechanisms that maintain homeostasis</b> in these coordinated systems.
</li>
<li> Relate knowledge of the structure and function of the cardiovascular and respiratory system
  to <b>disease processes</b>.</li>
<li> Use biomedical literature and the <b>method of scientific enquiry</b> to outline the
  cardiovascular and respiratory response to physical challenges.</li>
<li> Effectively participate in scheduled activities and in peer teams, seeking and reflecting
  on feedback to improve individual and group performance.</li>
</ul>

### Unit structure
#### Lectures

- Lectures will be conducted in person.<br>(Likely to be more engaging in person, possibly more benefit?)
  - Please ask questions. Put your hand up. If I don't see you - shout out.
- Lectures will be simulcast via Zoom.
  - You are welcome to ask questions via the chat function in Zoom.
- Lecture recordings will be available via Echo360 the day after the lecture.
- PDF of slides available by link from left hand menu, then "Print to PDF".

<h3>Unit structure</h3>
<h4>Practicals - Physiological measurement (Weeks 7 to 10)</h4>

Timetabled "Practical 2":</b> Physiology practicals (weeks 7 to 10).

Learning physiology through doing.

- Learning how to take some non-invasive cardiovascular and respiratory measurements.
- Provoking the body and observing the cardiovascular and respiratory response.
- Deducing <em>how</em> the response occurred.

Collection of data for Asessment Task 3.

### Assessment tasks
####

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment task 1: Formative quiz (0%). Due week 3.</h4>
<p>On-line in iLearn.</p>
<p>Reviews some of the respiratory component (physiology and anatomy) of MEDI2101.</p>
<p>0% assessment task, but it provides written feedback on working out specific answers where people might make mistakes (e.g., in a final exam).</p>
<ul>
  <li> Feedback is provided with each question.</li>
  <li> The mark will also provide you feedback on whether you are tracking well so far.</li>
</ul>

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment Task 2: Anatomy test (20%). During lecture, week 7.</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Anatomy quiz delivered during the 1st hour of the week 7 lecture.</li>
  <li> Created by Dr Mirjana Strkalj.</li>
  <li> It is likely to be challenging.</li>
</ul>

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment Task 3: Manuscript (35%) Due week 8 and 12</h4>
<p>Three parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Figure for an introduction.</b> Flow diagram explaining your hypothesis for what will
    happen in the experiment (Due week 8).
  <li> <b>Conducting experiment.</b> In class during physiological measurement practical. Not assessed, but will be beneficial because:
  <ul>
    <li>you will get to see and experience the physiology you will be talking about.</li>
    <li>teaching staff will likely guide you toward the correct thinking.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> <b>Discussion.</b> Discussion of results, limitations, and conclusion. (Due week 12)
</ol>

--
<h3>Assessment tasks</h3>
<h4>Assessment Task 4: Exam (45%). Held during exam period.</h4>
<p>Traditional final examination during examination period.</p>
<p> </p>
