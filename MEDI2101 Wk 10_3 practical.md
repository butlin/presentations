### What is an autonomic function test?
####

Any test that interrogates autonomic function for the purposes of diagnosing dysfunction.

**Types of tests include (but not limited to):**
-   Valsalva maneuvre
-   0.1 Hz breathing (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia)
-   head-up tilt test
-   active stand challenge
-   isometric hand-grip test

**Measurement devices:** Autonomic function tests are usually done using a lead II ECG and standard oscillometric automatic blood pressure cuff.

Most tests measure both the heart rate and blood pressure **response** to a **challenge** i.e. how heart rate and blood pressure respond to a perturbation to the cardiovascular and respiratory system.

### Valsalva maneuvre
####

<span style="color:red">**Do not attempt this test if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia.**</span>

1. Find your radial pulse and monitor your pulse. (This test is usually done with the nose clamped shut. But seeing as you have your finger on your pulse, you won't be doing that.)

2. Close your mouth.

3. Take a deep breath in then try to forcefully exhale (like you are blowing up a balloon) but keeping your mouth closed - that is, NOT letting air pass your lips.

4. Take note of any changes in your pulse rate.

5. Continue for roughly 10 to 15 seconds, then resume normal breathing.

### Isometric hand-grip challenge
#### Rest period

1. Choose a volunteer.
2. Get their maximum grip strength by starting the recording software and have the volunteer squeeze, with their dominant hand, the hand force meter maximally for 2 seconds. Read off the peak value of force achieved. Enter that value in the spreadsheet: <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT>
3. Have them sit down and place a blood pressure cuff on their non-dominant arm.
4. Fit them with the respiratory belt.
5. Start the recording software. 
6. On the turn of each minute, start the blood pressure monitor. Enter the value of blood pressure and pulse rate in the spreadsheet.
7. At the 30 second point of each minute, note the respiratory rate and enter that in the spreadsheet.

#### Hand-grip challenge and recovery

8. After 5 minutes rest (and 5 blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate measurements), have the volunteer squeeze and hold the force metre at 30% of the maximum.
9. Start the blood pressure cuff immediately. Every minute for three minutes, record blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. **Watch the force metre on the recording software. Ensure the volunteer is maintaining 30% of their maximum hand-grip strength.**
10. At three minutes, the volunteer can release the hand-grip. Immediately start the blood pressure monitor. Record blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate at approximately 30 seconds and 90 seconds following release of the hand-grip. Enter those values into the spreadsheet.

**Repeat for at least one more volunteer in your group.**
