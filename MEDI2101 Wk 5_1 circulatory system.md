--
### The transport functions of the cardiovascular system
####

The main functions of the circulatory system are:

- **transportation**
  -  brings oxygen to body cells and takes away carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products
  -  carries nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract to body cells
  -  carries hormones from endocrine glands to body cells
  -  carries immune cells, antibodies (in blood) to sites where
    needed
<span class="fragment">
- **regulation**
  -  helps regulate the pH of body fluid
  -  helps regulate body temperature
  -  regulates water content of cells
</span>

### The organisation of the cardiovascular system
#### The exception to the rule: Portal systems

**A portal system** is where a capillary bed drains through veins *into another capillary system*.

This is a limited occurrence in the human body:

- **hepatic portal system** takes blood from sections of the gastrointestinal capillary network and drains into capillaries of the liver.
- **hypophyseal portal system** at the base of the brain between the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland, transporting hormones.

- **Intima** Lining of epithelial cells forming the endothelium.
- **Media** Contains load bearing components: elastin; collagen (collagen is 10-50 times stiffer than elastin); and smooth muscle cells. Collagen and elastic fibers allow vessels to stretch to prevent over expansion due to the pressure that is exerted on the walls.
- **Adventitia** Strong outer covering of arteries and veins. Connective tissue and some collagen and elastin.

#### Capacitance (or compliance)

The arteries and veins are elastic. This means that they are compliant.

Compliance ($C$) is the ability to accommodate a volume ($V$) under a pressure ($P$).

\begin{equation}
  C = \dfrac{\Delta V}{\Delta P}
\end{equation}

<p class="fragment"><b>Role of compliance in arteries:</b> Arterial compliance transforms the pulsatile output of the heart into a continuous blood flow by the time the blood reaches the capillaries.</b>

### The five major types of blood vessels
#### Capacitance (or compliance)

**Role of capacitance in veins**

Allows for a great change in the blood volume that resides in the venous system.

That is, at rest, there is a large blood volume in the veins.

During times of high oxygen demand this can be mobilised (due to signals received by the central nervous system that result in increased sympathetic outflow and contraction of smooth muscle in the veins).
