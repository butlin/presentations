## LO2.2.1 Recognise the transport functions of the cardiovascular system (giving examples of the transport of materials: (i) entering, (ii) moving within, and (iii) leaving the body).

--
### The transport functions of the cardiovascular system
####

The main functions of the circulatory system are:

- **transportation**
  -  brings oxygen to body cells and takes away carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products
  -  carries nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract to body cells
  -  carries hormones from endocrine glands to body cells
  -  carries immune cells, antibodies (in blood) to sites where
    needed
<span class="fragment">
- **regulation**
  -  helps regulate the pH of body fluid
  -  helps regulate body temperature
  -  regulates water content of cells
</span>

---
## LO2.2.2 Recall the organisation of the cardiovascular system, including: (i) the central location of the heart, (ii) major blood vessels, (iii) pulmonary and systemic divisions of the circulation, and (iv) key portal systems.

### The organisation of the cardiovascular system
#### The exception to the rule: Portal systems

**A portal system** is where a capillary bed drains through veins *into another capillary system*.

This is a limited occurrence in the human body:

- **hepatic portal system** takes blood from sections of the gastrointestinal capillary network and drains into capillaries of the liver.
- **hypophyseal portal system** at the base of the brain between the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland, transporting hormones.

- **Adventitia** Strong outer covering of arteries and veins. Connective tissue and some collagen and elastin.

The arteries and veins are elastic. This means that they are compliant.

Compliance ($C$) is the ability to accommodate a volume ($V$) under a pressure ($P$).

\begin{equation}
  C = \dfrac{\Delta V}{\Delta P}
\end{equation}

### The five major types of blood vessels
#### Capacitance (or compliance)

**Role of capacitance in veins**

Allows for a great change in the blood volume that resides in the venous system.

That is, at rest, there is a large blood volume in the veins.

During times of high oxygen demand this can be mobilised (due to signals received by the central nervous system that result in increased sympathetic outflow and contraction of smooth muscle in the veins).

<aside class="notes">When at rest, the majority of the blood at any one time resides in the systemic veins. The veins have a very high capacitance to accommodate this. Veins also have smooth muscle and can contract (due to signals received by the central nervous system that result in increased sympathetic outflow) in order to distribute some this blood volume into the pulmonary vasculature and systemic arteries in order to increase blood flow and oxygenation of blood.</aside>
