### ECG
#### Volunteer

Today's experiment requires only one volunteer in each group.

They don't have to do any exercise.

There are no contraindications this week.

--
### ECG
#### Getting started

1. Attach the negative electrode to the "right arm" (right shoulder). What signal do you get?
2. Attach the positive electrode to the "left leg" (just above the left hip). What signal do you get?
3. Attach the ground electrode to the "left arm" (left shoulder). What signal do you get?
4. What lead configuration have you just created?

--

### ECG
#### What are you detecting?

1. Move around. What happens? What are you detecting?
2. Take some very big deep breaths in and out. What happens? What are you detecting?
3. Stay still. What is generating the signal that you are observing?

-- 
### ECG 
#### Electrical source $\longrightarrow$ mechanical event

1. Pause (stop) the signal acquisition.
2. Zoom in on a single cardiac cycle.
3. Identity the following features. For each feature, specify the cellular cause, and the mechanical event that it is associated with:
   - P wave
   - QRS complex
   - T wave

### ECG
#### Respiratory sinus arrythmia

The baroreceptors have a natural frequency of around 0.1 Hz (1 cycle every 10 seconds).

1. Over 1 to 2 minutes, take slow breaths, timing them to have 5 seconds of inspiration, and 5 seconds of expiration. Observe any heart rate changes.
2. What is the first thing that we are driving when we take these longer, slower breaths with increased tidal volumes?
3. Can you connect that to a change in arterial blood pressure?
4. Are your results consistent with a baroreceptor response to the changes in blood pressure?

--
### ECG
#### Lead configurations

1. Leaving the ECG dots (stickers) on the skin, unclip the leads from the ECG dots.
2. Rearrange the leads to give a Lead I configuration.
3. Compare the Lead I signal to the previous signal. What is different?
4. Why is it different?
