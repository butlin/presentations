### My limited lived experience
#### My immediate family

- **Grandfather, “Budge” Butlin**
  - Teacher in single teacher schools in regional NSW, including in indigenous communities.
- **Father, Ian Butlin**
  - A high school teacher giving support to indigenous students in a time of overt discrimination.
- **Myself**
  - Growing up as a child in Gilgandra (Wiradjuri for long water hole), witnessing socioeconomic disparity with my own eyes but through the educated guidance of my father and grandfather.

### My limited lived experience
#### Professor Noel Butlin (1921-1991)

"Noel Butlin provided a fundamental reassessment of the size and nature of the Aboriginal economy and population before 1788... . He convincingly argued that the early estimates
were likely to be substantial underestimates, and he eventually concluded that the pre-colonial population was between 1 and 1.5 million."

## LO4.3.2 Display cognisance of the cardiovascular and respiratory health barriers as faced by indigenous Australians.

--

"Indigenous people are culturally diverse, with cultural differences
providing unique access issues for health care services.
Health service planning should consider the needs of individual
communities, and rates of disease, rather than adopting a ‘one size
fits all’ approach."*

"Other barriers experienced by Indigenous people include:
poor coordination across the health system; socio-economic
disadvantage; poor access to acute care services and to primary
and specialist health care; sub-optimal provision of in-hospital
services; the availability of transport to health services; delays in
presentation; and language and cultural differences."*

- Home ownership increased to 42% (2021) from 40% (2016)<sup>1</sup>. Slow, but in right direction.
- Indigenous low birthweight babies decreased from 11.3% in 2007 to 10.7% in 2017<sup>2</sup>. (Low birthweight predictive of cardiovascular events in later life).
- Indigenous Australians aged 20-24 with a year 12 education increased from 45% in 2008 to 66% in 2018–19<sup>2</sup>. (Poor education predictive of poor quality of life, in turn a cardiovascular risk factor, also strongly associated with dementia.)
- Proportion of indigenous Australian smokers is declining<sup>2</sup>.
- Access to healthcare increasing (87% had a usual place to attend for healthcare in 2012–13, 92% in 2018-19<sup>2</sup>).

<p class="fragment">Many of the same improvements are seen in non-indigenous Australians too.</p>

#### Benefits for any patient - regardless of background

But also important in treatment of indigenous Australians. Health care personnel should:

- learn to communicate well<sup>1</sup>.
- look to pathways to address economic disadvantage, where present, to allow access to medical care needed<sup>2</sup>.
- not make assumptions.
- treat holistically.
