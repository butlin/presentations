$\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{pulse\~pressure\~(PP)} =  \mathrm{systolic\~pressure}-\mathrm{diastolic\~pressure}

$\begin{eqnarray}

<p class="fragement">The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the statistical mean of the wave (i.e. the average).<br>We do not need to <em>estimate</em> MAP (using the "1/3rd rule") if we have the waveform - we can find the average to get the true mean.</p>

    <p>It is the pressure difference that drives blood flow.</p> 
    <p class="fragment">A sometimes unexpected (but always present) feature is that systolic pressure is higher in the brachial artery (large arteries) than in the aorta. This is due to wave reflection augmenting the waveform in the large arteries, but to a lesser extent at the aorta.</p>

### Blood flow, pressure gradients and resistance
####

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{flow} = \dfrac{P_1 - P_2}{\mathrm{resistance}}
\end{equation}

For those that have done a little physics, you may recognise this from electrical work and Ohm's law:

\begin{equation}
  V  =  I\cdot R
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{or\~\~}I  =  \frac{V}{R}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{flow} = \dfrac{\mathrm{potential\~difference\~or\~pressure\~difference}}{\mathrm{resistance}}
\end{equation}

### Blood flow, pressure gradients and resistance

Blood flow in arteries can often be analysed through electrical model current flow (electrical) and fluid flow (blood) are analogous in many aspects of physics.

### Blood flow, pressure gradients and resistance
####
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{flow} = \dfrac{P_1 - P_2}{\mathrm{resistance}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{resistance} \propto \dfrac{1}{\mathrm{vessel\~radius}^4}
\end{equation}

Therefore,

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{flow} \propto \left(P_1 - P_2\right)\cdot \mathrm{vessel\~radius}^4
\end{equation}

<span class="fragment">
<b>Example:</b>

If we halve the radius of a vessel, we increase resistance by $2^{4}=16$, resulting in $1/16^{th}$ of the flow.

<aside class="notes">Flow is proportional to the pressure difference. If we consider the venous system near atmospheric pressure (0 mmHg, though actually pressure in the venous system is a little higher than this), then the driving force for blood flow is the arterial pressure minus 0 mmHg. Sympathetic stimulation changes the resistances of vessels. Increased resistance decreases flow and decreased resistance increases flow. The pressure at which there is zero flow is called the critical closing pressure (this is more applicable in the intracrannial space - more on this later).</aside>

    <p>Flow is driven by a pressure difference between two regions.</p>
    <p>Therefore, blood will flow from the aorta, to the arteries, to the arterioles, to the capillaries, to the venules, to the veins, then to the vena cava as pressure gets lower and lower as we travel through the systemic vasculature.</p>

  \mathrm{CO}   & =  \dfrac{\mathrm{MAP} - \mathrm{venous\~pressure}}{\mathrm{TPR}}\\\\

### MAP, CO and TPR
#### (Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance)

**What is total peripheral resistance?**

The combined resistance of all arteries, arterioles and capillaries in the systemic vasculature.

It can be modified by:
- combined regional changes in arteriolar resistance
- combined regional changes in regulation at the pre-capillary area

## LO2.2.7 Understand that there is local (regional) short-term and long-term autoregulation of blood flow and the mechanisms driving that regulation (oxygen, metabolic, and myogenic theories; angiogenesis and collateral circulation).

--
<!-- .slide:  data-auto-animate -->
### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
####

We will be talking next week about systemic regulation of blood pressure and blood flow.

However, different organs need different blood flow according to the activity and metabolic requirements.

Therefore, there must be **regional** as well as **systemic** regulation of blood flow.

--
<!-- .slide:  data-auto-animate -->
### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
####

Autoregulation describes the ability of local tissue to counter local blood flow changes due to systemic changes in blood pressure.

Autoregulation exists to some extent in all tissues, but is very strong in the brain (cerebral autoregulation) and in the coronary circulation.

### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
#### Example

During exercise, skeletal muscle can have as much as a 10 times greater oxygen demand and creates more carbon dioxide that needs to be removed, therefore requires greater blood flow. Vasodilation in the arteries supplying the skeletal muscle can in part facilitate this (along with increased cardiac output).

<p class="fragment">At the same time, the brain requires a constant supply of blood, regardless of changes in cardiac output. Local vascular regulation ensures that the blood flow to the brain is constant, in the face of changes in blood pressure and cardiac output.</p>

<p class="fragment">The precise <em>mechanism</em> behind regional control of blood flow is unknown - but we have some theories...</p>

<!-- .slide:  data-auto-animate -->
### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
#### Theories for local autoregulation mechanism

**Vasodilator theory of local response to low oxygen**

1. $\downarrow$ oxygen concentration in blood
1. $\uparrow$ vasodilator substance formation
1. $\uparrow$ diffusion of vasodilators to interstitial fluid
1. $\downarrow$ resistance at local precapillary sphincters and metarterioles.

**Vasodilators:** adenosine (through increased ATP degradation), adenosine phosphates, carbon dioxide, potassium ions, hydrogen ions (from lactic acid)

<!-- .slide:  data-auto-animate -->
### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
#### Theories for local autoregulation mechanism

**Oxygen (or nutrient) demand theory of local response to low oxygen**

Oxygen is required for smooth muscle contraction.

Therefore, absence of oxygen means smooth muscle cannot contract i.e. dilation and lower resistance.

<!-- .slide:  data-auto-animate -->
### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
#### Theories for local autoregulation mechanism

**Metabolic theory**

1. $\uparrow$ blood pressure
1. $\uparrow$ blood flow
1. $\downarrow$ decrease concentration of metabolites (due to greater volume passing through vessel bed)
1. $\downarrow$ vasodilation ($\uparrow$) vasoconstriction
1. $\downarrow$ blood flow

--
<!-- .slide:  data-auto-animate -->
### Local (regional) blood flow autoregulation
#### Theories for local autoregulation mechanism

**Myogenic theory**

Sudden stretch of the vessel wall causes smooth muscle to contract.

i.e. direct myogenic response of smooth muscle to stretch decreases vessel diameter and increases resistance.

**Mechanism:** stretch opens calcium channels and influx of calcium causes muscle contraction.

<p style="color:white;font-size:1.5em">So which theory is correct?</p>
