### Hypertension
#### Morbidity

<b>morbidity:</b> The unhealthy characteristics of a person, usually associated with a disease.

<b>Hypertension example:</b> High blood pressure is a morbidity associated with hypertension. There may be other <em>co-morbidities</em> such as atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, high cholesterol, etc.

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate  -->
### Hypertension
#### Mortality


<b>mortality:</b> A biomedical statistic characterising the number or proportion of people that die from a condition.

<b>Hypertension example:</b> In the USA, there are 10.8 deaths per 100,000 people directly attributable purely to hypertension and 30\% of all mortality is attributable to cardiovascular diseases in general*.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation">*U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf">National Vital Statistics Reports, (2019) 68:9.</a></p>

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate  -->
### Hypertension
#### Risk

<b>risk:</b> The probability of a detrimental event occurring e.g. contracting a disease; a sudden event like a heart attack; or death.

<b>Hypertension example:</b> "Roughly half the people with untreated hypertension die of heart disease related to poor blood flow (ischemic heart disease) and another third die of stroke."*

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate  -->
### Hypertension
#### Risk factor

<b>risk factor:</b> A quantifiable indicator of the probability of someone either (a) contracting a disease (risk of disease) or (b) death (risk of mortality).

<b>Hypertension example:</b> Having high cholesterol is a risk factor for developing hypertension.

#### When do you measure blood pressure?
<img src='images/ABPM_example1.png' width="100%">
<p>Blood pressure constantly varies. It is usually higher during the day than at night (nocturnal dipping), and usually higher when measured in a clinical environment than when measured outside of the clinic. It also varies from minute to minute.</p>

    <p>By wearing an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 24 hours, the variation in blood pressure throughout the day and night can be captured.

### Hypertension
#### What causes hypertension?

We can largely answer this question from what we have learnt in the unit by asking the question: What raises blood pressure?*

<span class="fragment">
<ul>
  <li> <b>autonomic function:</b> Increased sympathetic outflow chronically raising heart rate, cardiac contractility, total peripheral resistance and/or altering kidney function.</li>
  <li> <b>systemic arteries:</b> Stiffening of the arteries increasing total peripheral resistance.</li>
  <li> <b>kidneys:</b> Kidney dysfunction, chronically upregulating blood pressure.</li>
<ul>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation">* Heart rate and stroke volume do not generally increase chronically as a cause of hypertension.</p>

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate  -->
### Hypertension
#### What causes autonomic dysfunction, increased artery stiffness, and kidney dysfunction?

<ul>
  <li> The causes of hypertension are multifactorial, and most probably cases of essential hypertension* do not have a single cause.<br><br></li>
 <li> Genetic studies have revealed a lot of genetic markers associated with function of the vascular endothelium associated with hypertension, but there hypertension is definitely not a single gene (or even a few multiple genes) disease.<br><br></li>
 <li> Treatment does not usually tackle the root cause (the root cause often being unknown) but target the most effective way to lower blood pressure whilst minimising side effects.</li>
</ul>

### Hypertension

Risk factors <em>for developing</em> hypertension:
- smoking
- a diet high in sodium (salt)
- physical inactivity
- being overweight or obese
- drinking too much alcohol
- high cholesterol

### Hypertension
#### What causes autonomic dysfunction, increased artery stiffness, and kidney dysfunction?

Hypertension is a risk factor for...

- left ventricular hypertrophy
- heart failure
- renal damage
- retinopathy
- cerebrovascular disease
- haemorrhagic stroke
- coronary artery disease

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate  -->
### Hypertension
#### Types of hypertension

Hypertension can be divided into either being "essential" or "secondary".

<b>Essential hypertension:</b> Chronically high blood pressure with no known cause (the majority of hypertension cases).

<b>Secondary hypertension:</b> Chronically high blood pressure with an identified cause. Makes up 5 to 10\% of hypertension cases. e.g. renal disease; renal artery stenosis; primary hyperaldosteronism; drug-induced hypertension (common side effect of the contraceptive pill) etc.

<b>Heart rate (HR):</b>	the number of beats of the heart per unit time (e.g. beats per minute bpm)

<b>Stroke volume (SV):</b> the volume of blood ejected by the left ventricle into the aorta in a single stroke (beat) of the heart

<b>Cardiac output (CO):</b>	the average rate of blood being ejected by the left ventricle into the aorta
