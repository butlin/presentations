### Isometric hand-grip challenge
#### Rest period

1. Choose a volunteer.
2. Get their maximum grip strength by starting the recording software and have the volunteer squeeze, with their dominant hand, the hand force meter maximally for 2 seconds. Read off the peak value of force achieved. Enter that value in the spreadsheet: <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT>
3. Have them sit down and place a blood pressure cuff on their non-dominant arm.
4. Fit them with the respiratory belt.
5. Start the recording software. 
6. On the turn of each minute, start the blood pressure monitor. Enter the value of blood pressure and pulse rate in the spreadsheet.
7. At the 30 second point of each minute, note the respiratory rate and enter that in the spreadsheet.

8. After 5 minutes rest (and 5 blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate measurements), have the volunteer squeeze and hold the force metre at 30% of the maximum.
9. Start the blood pressure cuff immediately. Every minute for three minutes, record blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. **Watch the force metre on the recording software. Ensure the volunteer is maintaining 30% of their maximum hand-grip strength.**
10. At three minutes, the volunteer can release the hand-grip. Immediately start the blood pressure monitor. Record blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate at approximately 30 seconds and 90 seconds following release of the hand-grip. Enter those values into the spreadsheet.

**Repeat for at least one more volunteer in your group.**

### Isometric hand-grip challenge
#### You will need:

- a stopwatch (e.g. on your phone) or clock with a second hand or second read-out
- a non-fragile object that you can place in your hand to squeeze. e.g.
  - hair brush handle (a larger handle will be more comfortable)
  - bundled up thick socks (or multiple thin socks... I guess)
  - table leg
  - stress ball
- if you have an automatic blood pressure machine, fit the cuff to your non-dominant arm.

### Isometric hand-grip challenge
#### Rest (baseline)

**Rest (baseline)**

1.  Get a feel for what your maximum grip strength is by squeezing your chosen object maximally.
2.  Find a comfortable place to sit.
3.  Each minute over 5 minutes, note your pulse rate (and blood pressure if you have a machine) and enter it into the spreadsheet: <https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT>
4.  Note your respiratory rate and depth (qualitatively).

#### Hand grip challenge and recovery

5. Squeeze and hold the force meter at approximately 30% of your previous maximum. This is an exercise - your muscles should begin to feel tired during this challenge.
6. Every minute for three minutes, note your pulse rate (and blood pressure if you have a machine) and enter it into the spreadsheet. Note, qualitatively, your breathing rate and depth.
7.  At three minutes, release the hand-grip. Record your pulse rate (and blood pressure) approximately 30 seconds and 90 seconds following release of the hand-grip. Enter those values into the spreadsheet.
