<!-- <img class="r-stretch" src="images/ArterialVenousPressures.png"> -->

<aside class="notes">Blood pressure is not (cannot be) the same throughout the vasculature. A decrease in mean pressure as we move distal to the heart is required as it is the pressure difference between two sites that drives blood flow. This diagram shows the typical decrease in mean arterial pressure in the systemic circulation as we move away from the heart. An often unexpected (but always present) feature is that systolic pressure is higher in the brachial artery (large arteries) than in the aorta. This is due to wave reflection augmenting the waveform in the large arteries, but to a lesser extent at the aorta.</aside>

%    <h5>The argument \emph{against} long-term blood pressure control by baroreceptors}
%     ``One reason that the baroreceptors have been considered by some physiologists to be relatively unimportant in chronic regulation of arterial pressure is that they tend to reset in 1 to 2 days to the pressure level to which they are exposed. That is, if the arterial pressure rises from the normal value of 100 mmHg to 160 mmHg, a very high rate of baroreceptor impulses are at first transmitted. During the next few minutes, the rate of firing diminishes considerably; then it diminishes much more slowly during the next 1 to 2 days, at the end of which time the rate of firing will have returned to nearly normal despite the fact that the mean arterial pressure still remains at 160 mmHg.''\footnote{Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology.}

%     ``Experimental studies, however, have suggested that the baroreceptors do not completely reset and may therefore contribute to long-term blood pressure regulation, especially by influencing sympathetic nerve activity of the kidneys. For example, with prolonged increases in arterial pressure, the baroreceptor reflexes may mediate decreases in renal sympathetic nerve activity that promote increased excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys. This action, in turn, causes a gradual decrease in blood volume, which helps to restore arterial pressure toward normal.''\footnote{Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology.}
