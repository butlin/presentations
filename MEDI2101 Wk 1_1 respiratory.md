### The root function of the cardiorespiratory system
#### &nbsp;

Bacteria do not have a cardiovascular or respiratory system.

And yet they live.

### The root function of the cardiorespiratory system
####
* **Cellular respiration**
    * breakdown of organic molecules to produce ATP.
* **Energy conversion**
    * A sufficient supply of oxygen is required for the aerobic respiratory machinery (e.g. Kreb's Cycle) and to convert stored energy.
* **Gas exchange**
    * Cellular metabolism generates carbon dioxide (\(CO_2\) must be removed from the cell; \ce{O2} must be able to enter the cell.

--

### The root function of the cardiorespiratory system
#### Comparing and contrasting surface diffusion, gills and lungs as respiratory apparatus

* **Single-cell organisms** 
    * Exchange gases directly across their cell membrane. The slow diffusion rate of oxygen relative to carbon dioxide limits the size of single-celled organisms.
* **Small living organisms** 
    * Simple animals that lack specialized respiratory exchange surfaces have flattened, tubular, or thin shaped body plans, which are the most efficient for gas exchange. These simple animals are rather small in size.
* **Larger animals** 
    * Cannot maintain gas exchange by diffusion across their outer surface. They will have some kind of respiratory surface that increases the surface area for exchange, thus allowing for larger bodies.

### The root function of the cardiorespiratory system
#### Comparing and contrasting surface diffusion, gills and lungs as respiratory apparatus

##### Methods of respiration

* **Sponges and jellyfish**
    * Lack specialized organs for gas exchange and take in gases directly from the surrounding water.
* **Annelids (inc. flatworms) and arthropods**
    * Use their outer surfaces as gas
exchange surfaces.
* **Fish**
    * Use gills.
* **Terrestrial vertebrates**
    * Utilize internal lungs

<p style="color:white;font-size:1.5em">Eels (a fish) obtain 60% of their oxygen through their skin.</p>
<p class="fragment" style="color:white;font-size:1.5em">Why can't humans breath through their skin?</p>
<p class="fragment" style="color:white;font-size:1.5em">We do - but only about 1% of our carbon dioxide is removed via the skin.</p>
<p class="fragment" style="color:white">Constraints of water loss dictate that terrestrial animals must develop more efficient respiration without dehydration (lungs).</p>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li> Flatworms and annelids use their outer surfaces as gas exchange surfaces.</li>
<li> Earthworms have a series of thin-walled blood vessels known as capillaries. Gas exchange occurs at capillaries located throughout the body as well as those in the respiratory surface.</li>
<li> Amphibians use their skin as a respiratory surface.</li>
<li> Frogs eliminate carbon dioxide 2.5 times as fast through their skin as they do through their lungs.</li>
<li> Eels (a fish) obtain 60% of their oxygen through their skin.</li>
<li> Humans exchange only 1% of their carbon dioxide through their skin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gills greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange. They occur in a variety of animal groups including arthropods (including some terrestrial crustaceans), annelids, fish, and amphibians. Gills typically are convoluted outgrowths containing blood vessels covered by a thin epithelial layer. Typically gills are organized into a series of plates and may be internal (as in crabs and fish) or external to the body (as in some amphibians).</p>

<p>Gills are very efficient at removing oxygen from water: there is only 1/20 the amount of oxygen present in water as in the same volume of air.</p>

<p>Water flows over gills in one direction while blood flows in the opposite direction through gill capillaries. This counter-current flow maximizes oxygen transfer.</p>

### The root function of the cardiorespiratory system
#### Tracheal systems

* Many terrestrial animals have their **respiratory surfaces** inside the body and connected to the outside by a series of tubes.
* **Tracheae** are tubes that carry air directly to cells for gas exchange.
* **Spiracles** are openings at the body surface that lead to tracheae that branch into smaller tubes known as tracheoles.
* **Body movements** or contractions speed up the rate of diffusion of gases from tracheae into body cells.
* However, tracheae will not function well in animals whose body is longer than about 5 cm.

## LO1.1.2 Describe the oxygen cascade and the steps that it comprises, mapping the key factors that influence gas exchange between the atmosphere and arterial blood.

--

### The oxygen cascade
#### 

**The function of the cardiorespiratory system (with regards to to oxygen)**

* Get the oxygen from atmospheric air to all of the body's cells.

<p class="fragment">Gases (and fluids) move down a pressure gradient. That is, they flow
from a higher pressure region to a lower pressure region.</p>

--

### The oxygen cascade
#### Dalton's law and partial pressure

**Dalton's law**

The sum of the individual pressures that make up a mixture of gases
is the total pressure of that mixture of gases.

The pressure of an individual gas within a mixture of gases is known
as the *partial pressure*.

--

### The oxygen cascade
#### Dalton's law and partial pressure

Using Dalton's law we can calculate the the partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>) in atmospheric ("dry") air and humid air (as found in the lungs). In reading this table, note that gases flow from regions of higher partial pressure to lower partial pressure.

## LO1.1.4 Understand the limits and benefits of one, two, three, and four chamber hearts as found in nature.

### Evolution and the heart
####

The heart allows movement of blood gases dissolved in a fluid around the body.

The heart allows for the *circulation* of fluid (usually blood, but in the case of spiders, haemolymph) transporting oxygen received at the lungs to the cells, where the oxygen is used, and the fluid is then returned to the lungs again.

### LO1.1.5 Define and understand the relationships: pressure, pressure gradient, flow, velocity of flow, resistance and radius.
####

See this week's on-line activity in iLearn and reading material (physics lecture).

If you do not understand the concepts of pressure, flow, resistance and radius it makes it very hard to understand:

* **the respiratory system**
    * flow of air in tubes due to a pressure differential
* **the cardiovascular system**
    * flow of fluid (blood) in tubes due to a pressure differential
* **cardiovascular regulation**
    * in part through changes in radius of vessels to modulate resistance, to alter pressure and blood flow
* **respiratory diseases**
    * can alter radius of airway, increasing resistance, decreasing air flow
