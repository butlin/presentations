### The five major functions of the respiratory system
#### 
The 5 major functions of the respiratory system are to:


- **conduct air** from atmosphere to alveoli and vice versa.
- **condition the air** and protect the lungs from inhaled, problematic substances.
- facilitate **gas exchange** with blood.
- assist in **blood pH regulation**.
- allow for **vocalisation** for communication.
    
<p class="fragment">All of these functions, other than vocalisation, are to facilitate (or in the case of pH, a result of) respiration.</p>

### The five major functions of the respiratory system
#### 

Respiration in multi-cellular life can be used to refer to two different things:

- **Cellular respiration**: The **intracellular reaction** of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) with organic molecules to produce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and (importantly) energy (ATP).
- **External respiration**: The **movement of gases** between the environment (air for land-dwelling life) and the body's cells to supply O<sub>2</sub> and remove CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p class="fragment">When we are talking about the movement of air through the lungs, we are addressing part of the pathway of external respiration, not cellular respiration.</p>

Function of the larynx

The larynx contains the epiglottis (diversion of food) and the vocal cords (forced breath hold, vocalisation).

- **epiglottis:** elastic cartilage "trap door" that is closed when swallowing food/liquid to prevent food/liquid from entering the trachea (wind pipe)
- **false vocal cords:** close to block/hold breath eg. when lifting a heavy object (these "vocal" cords don't produce sound)
- **true vocal cords:** elastic ligaments that when stretched, produce sound as air passes by them.
  - pitch = degree of stretch
  - amplitude = amount of air pressure applied

The respiratory mucosa lining the conducting airways conditions air before it reaches the alveoli.

- **Warming** 
  - Air is warmed to 37<sup>o</sup>C so core body temp is maintained and to protect the alveoli.
- **Humidifying** 
  - Water vapor is added to 100% humidity so the exchange epithelium doesn’t dry
- **Filtering** 
  - Removal of particles and pathogens to protect the body from inflammation and infection.

### The five major functions of the respiratory system
#### Conditioning of air and protection from inhaled substances

The mucosal lining is a fluid. Therefore, there is a surface tension drawing the wetted surfaces together especially in the elastic, flexible alveoli.

An air pressure is needed to overcome this surface tension (Laplace Law).

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{pressure} = \dfrac{2\times\mathrm{surface\~tension}}{\mathrm{radius\~of\~alveoli}}
\end{equation}

<p class="fragment">If the mucosal fluid was pure water, a pressure of 18 cmH<sub>2</sub>O would be required to keep the alveoli open (<em>Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology</em>).

**Alveolar stability**
      
Action of surfactant:

$\dfrac{2T\downarrow}{R}=P\downarrow$

- Surfactant differentially reduces surface tension, more at lower volumes and less at higher volumes, giving alveolar stability and reducing the likelihood of alveolar collapse.
- Surfactant is formed relatively late in fetal life.
- Premature infants born without adequate amounts. experience respiratory distress requiring immediate therapy.

### The five major functions of the respiratory system
#### Vocalisation
      
Speech (or just vocal noise) requires three main processes to work together:

1. Air must be in motion (muscles of respiration and clear airways).
1. Vibrations must be established in the air stream (vocal cords).
1. The buzzing sound of the vibrating air stream must be altered by the shape of the resonator (which includes the throat, as well as the oral and nasal cavities).

**Boyle's law**

That pressure ($P$) of a fixed mass of material (e.g. air) is inversely proportional to volume ($V$).

\begin{equation}
P 	\propto \dfrac{1}{V}
\end{equation}

The corollary is that if the pressure on a material is changed, the volume must also change proportionally.

\begin{equation}
P_1\cdot V_1 = P_2 \cdot V_2

Boyle's Law states that if the volume of a fluid is changed, then the pressure must change inversely and proportionally. 

So if we halve the volume, the pressure would double.

How does Boyle's Law relate to inspiration?

If we increase the volume of the lungs, it will reduce the pressure within the lungs.

$P_1\cdot V_1 = P_2 \cdot V_2$

<p class="fragment">As fluid (includes gases) will move from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure (from the surrounding atmosphere, into the lungs).</p>
<p class="fragment">This air movement is <b>bulk flow</b> because the entire gas mixture is moving (not individual gases, as in diffusion across a <em>partial pressure</em> gradient).</p>

This means the intrapleural pressure would be equal to the lung pressure.

The lack of a negative intrapleural pressure on the elastic tissue of the lung means that the elastic tissue recoils to its unstretched state.

That is, the lung collapses.

### The four pulmonary volumes and four pulmonary capacities
#### The pulmonary volumes

- **tidal volume**
  - the amount of air inspired (or expired) in a single, normal breath. For an adult, tidal volume is around 0.5 litres.
- **inspiratory reserve volume**
  - on a big breath in, the maximum amount of air that can be inspired above the normal tidal volume. For an adult, around 3 litres.
- **expiratory reserve volume**
  - on a big breath out, the maximum amount of air that can be expired beyond the normal tidal volume. For an adult, around 1.1 L.
- **residual volume**
  - the amount of air left in the lungs after a maximal breath out. For an adult, around 1.2 L.

### The four pulmonary volumes and four pulmonary capacities
#### Minute respiratory volume, or minute ventilation

The rate at which air moves through the lungs is called the minute ventilation, or minute respiratory volume ($\dot{V}$). If we know:

- **the tidal volume ($V_T$)**
  - the volume breathed with each breath
- **the respiratory rate ($RR$)**
  - the number of breaths per minute

we can calculate the minute ventilation

\begin{equation}
\dot{V} = V_T \times RR
\end{equation}
