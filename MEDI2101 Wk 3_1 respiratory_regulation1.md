### MEDI2101 Cardiovascular and Respiratory System
#### To do in Week 3

<a href="https://ilearn.mq.edu.au/course/view.php?id=64513#section-8"> MEDI2101 iLearn Week 3</a>

--
###
#### A lot of work?

- In theory, each 10 credit point unit should have around 10 to 12 hours of content / work each week (including time to complete assessments).
- I have tried to put together the best material to help you progress toward a medical / clinical career.
- Nothing is compulsory. As an adult learner, you can decide whether you engage a lot or a little.

###
#### Anatomy quizzes - or anything else missed?

Please send me a private message through the iLearn private message system.

I am very happy to extend the closing time on any of the anatomy formative quizzes if you have not completed them.

Respiration changes in response to the physiological status and surrounding environment. That is a **change** in the physiology or environment needs to be **detected** and a response invoked as a result. The inputs that regulate respiration include:

- **higher order brain centres** responding to environmental stressors.
- **peripheral chemoreceptors** signal received by the glossopharyngeal nerve.
- **central chemoreceptors** located in the intracranial space
- **other sensory nerves**

### Arterial blood gases and pH
#### Carbon dioxide in blood

Dissolving of carbon dioxide in blood (water):

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{CO}_2 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \overset{\mathrm{carbonic~anhydrase}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{CO}_3 \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^+ + \mathrm{HCO}_3^-
\end{equation}

<p class="fragment">carbon dioxide + water $\longrightarrow$ carbonic acid $\longrightarrow$ hydrogen ions + bicarbonate ions</p>

### Arterial blood gases and pH
#### Carbon dioxide in blood
Carriage of carbon dioxide by haemoglobin:

$\mathrm{CO}_2 + \mathrm{Hb} \longleftrightarrow \mathrm{HbCO}_2$

carbon dioxide + haemoglobin $\\longleftrightarrow$ carbaminohaemoglobin

--
### Arterial blood gases and pH
#### Oxygen in blood

Oxygen is carried in two ways in the blood:

1. bound to haemoglobin
1. dissolved in plasma

--
### Arterial blood gases and pH
####
We have established that:
- oxygen is important for cellular respiration
- carbon dioxide is a by-product of cellular respiration and needs to be removed
- carbon dioxide decreases pH<sup>1</sup>

Effective functioning of body processes require rather narrow ranges of these parameters, <em>especially pH</em>.

### Chemoreceptor input to the respiratory centre
#### Central chemoreceptors

Centres in the brain that regulate breathing, in addition to receiving signals from the peripheral chemoreceptors, are *directly* chemosensitive.

-  Highly sensitive to H<sup>+</sup> concentration
   -  However, H<sup>+</sup> ions do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier
   -  Therefore, changes in blood H<sup>+</sup> concentration have little effect on central chemoreceptors
-  Not directly sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
-  Not particular sensitive to O<sub>2</sub> concentration

--
<!-- .slide: data-background="#111111" -->
<p style="color:white;font-size:1.5em">Then how do the central chemoreceptors modify ventilation in response to partial pressures of blood gases?</p>

--
### Chemoreceptor input to the respiratory centre
#### Central chemoreceptors

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{CO}\_2 + \mathrm{H}\_2\mathrm{O} \overset{\mathrm{carbonic~anhydrase}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{H}\_2\mathrm{CO}\_3 \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^+ + \mathrm{HCO}_3^-
\end{equation}

carbon dioxide + water $\longrightarrow$ carbonic acid $\longrightarrow$ hydrogen ions + bicarbonate ions

-  CO<sub>2</sub> easily passes through the blood-brain barrier (unlike H<sup>+</sup>)
-  Therefore, when blood CO<sub>2</sub> rises, so does cerebrospinal fluid CO<sub>2</sub>.
-  Cerebrospinal fluid CO<sub>2</sub> is converted to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>.
-  The central chemoreceptors, which are highly sensitive to H<sup>+</sup>, sense the cerebrospinal fluid H<sup>+</sup>.

<!-- .slide: data-background="#111111" -->

<aside class="notes">
The chemosensing pathway provides a negative feedback loop for changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide, and H<sup>+</sup> in blood by sensing these parameters, the feedback leading to a change in ventilation and an opposite change in that parameter. The figure gives the example of blood oxygen. A drop in blood oxygen would be detected by chemosensors, the signal fed to the respiratory centre, where the somatic neuronal output increases respiratory rate and tidal volume, increasing the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in the alveoli, and therefore more oxygen will diffuse into blood (opposing the initial drop in blood oxygen).

### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
####

**reflex**

The sum total of any particular involuntary activity.

<p class="citation">Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 29th Ed.</p>

--
<!-- .slide: data-background="#111111" -->
<p style="color:white;font-size:1.5em">What are some reflexes that would influence breathing / ventilation?</p>

--
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Hering-Breuer reflex

-  **Stretch receptors** are located in the bronchi and bronchioles.
-  At high levels of stretch, they communicate to the central respiratory centre via the vagi to **cease inspiration**.
-  **Only activated during hyperinflation** (tidal volume > 3$\times$ normal tidal volume).

--
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Apnoea

The cessation of breathing for a period of time. 

Apnoea can be:

- **centrally caused** loss of pacing signal from respiratory centre;
- **physically caused** relaxation of the soft palate occluding the airway; or
- **a reflex response via the juxtacapillary ("J") receptors** in wall alveoli, in contact with capillaries and can produce apnoea. Stimulated by:
  -  pulmonary congestion
  -  pneumonia
  -  exogenous/endogenous chemicals (histamine, serotonin)

<p class="fragment">After cessation of apnoea, there is usually a reflex response of increased breathing rate / tidal volume, as blood oxygen would have depleted and carbon dioxide increased, stimulating the chemoreceptors.</p>

--
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Increased ventilation

<p>Occurs under a number of scenarios. There are at least four different receptors that can increase minute ventilation, and may lead to hyperventilation:</p>
<ul>
  <li> irritant receptors</li>
  <li> proprioceptors</li>
  <li> metaboreceptors</li>
  <li> thermoreceptors</li>
  <li> pain receptors</li>
</ul>

<div class="fragment">
<p><b>Note:</b> Some of these mechanisms may lead to hyperventilation, but not all increases in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume are hyperventilation.</p>

<p><b>Hyperventilation:</b> An abnormally high rate and/or depth of breathing, <b>resulting in loss of blood CO<sub>2</sub>.  Hyperventilation is <em>not</em> simply a fast breathing rate.</b></p>
</div>

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate data-background-image="images/bleach.jpg" -->
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Increased ventilation - irritant receptors

**Irritant receptors in the lungs** stimulated by harmful chemicals (e.g. ammonia, sulphur dioxide).

Irritant receptor stimulation results in reflex hyperventilation and bronchospasm, reducing likelihood of harmful chemicals entering the alveoli.

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate data-background-image="images/Sprinter_at_starting_block.jpg" -->
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Increased ventilation - proprioceptors

**Proprioceptors** (provide sense of position) in joints, muscles, tendons when stimulated also cause hyperventilation.

Immediately activated with dynamic exercise, causing increased breathing rate/volume even before increased oxygen demand.

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate data-background-image="images/Sprinter_at_starting_block.jpg" -->
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Increased ventilation - metaboreceptors

**Metaboreceptors** are peripheral nerve endings that respond to metabolites such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup>, lactate. Primarily in skeletal muscle.

<p class="fragment">These are different to chemoreceptors (located in the carotid bifurcation, aortic arch, and vasomotor centre of the brain) in that they are not sensing circulating blood gasses/H<sup>+</sup> but the local metabolite concentrations in the muscle.</p>

--
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate data-background-image="images/snow.jpg" -->
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Increased ventilation - thermoreceptors 

**Thermoreceptors**, mostly cutaneous, responding to body temperature outside of the normal range. Both increased *and* decreased body temperature can cause increased ventilation.

--
### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Increased ventilation - pain receptors

**Pain receptors** also signal to the respiratory centre.

Also can cause a hyperventillatory response.

### Reflex inputs to the respiratory centre
#### Cough reflex
-  Protective reflex caused by irritation of parts of the respiratory tract beyond nose like larynx, trachea and bronchi.
-  Communicated by vagal nerve.
-  Cough begins with deep inspiration followed by forceful expiration with closed glottis.
-  Intrapleural pressure rises above 100 mmHg.
-  Then, glottis is suddenly opened with explosive outflow of air at a high velocity (up to 160 km/hr) so the irritants may be expelled out of the respiratory tract.
