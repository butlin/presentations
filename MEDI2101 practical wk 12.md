### Week 12 practical: Respiratory function
####

Blood carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>) as the principal factor that affects the rate and depth of breathing, respiratory sensations, air hunger and breathlessness.

### Regulation of breathing automaticity by CO<sub>2</sub>
#### Carbon dioxide chemosensation by the brain

Central respiratory chemoreception (CRC) fundamentals.
- Drive to breathe
- Maintains pH within narrow limits

### Regulation of breathing automaticity by CO<sub>2</sub>
#### Carbon dioxide chemosensation by the brain

Many fundamentals are still unknown.

Central respiratory chemoreception (CRC) is one of the few sensory processes whose molecular and cellular basis remain largely unknown. 
- What is sensed: CO2 or H<sup>+</sup> ?
- Where is it sensed: glia, neurons? 

Also one of the few sensory processes whose neuronal network and wiring remains unclear.
- How many chemoreceptive nuclei exist in the brain?
- How is breathing regulated by CRC(s)?
- How does peripheral O<sub>2</sub> carotid body chemoreceptors inputs integrate with central pH/pCO<sub>2</sub> respiratory chemoreception?

#### 2006 RetroTrapezoid Nucleus (RTN) neurons

RTN, the modern incarnation of "Area M"

RTN neuron activity encodes arterial pH/pCO<sub>2</sub>

### A brief history of the landmark discoveries
#### What we’ve known for over a century

- pCO<sub>2</sub> is tightly regulated
- Normal pCO<sub>2</sub> is around 38 mmHg.
- For every 1 mmHg rise in pCO<sub>2</sub> ventilation increases ~2 litres/min in man at rest.
- 2 mmHg rise in pCO<sub>2</sub> decrease pH by less than 0.01 pH units.
- Carotid body sensory inputs influence the gain of the breathing responses to CO<sub>2</sub>.
  - CB stimulation (hypoxia) increases gain
  - CB inhibition/excision reduces gain

<blockquote>Implication
<ul>
    <li>Brain sensors for pCO<sub>2</sub> / pH must be exquisitely sensitive to changes in these variables AND / OR</li>
    <li>Response to pCO<sub>2</sub> / pH is tuned by networks evolved to produce extremely high gain.</li>
</ul>

### Sleep disordered breathing
#### Sleep unmasks a sensitive hypocapnia-induced apnoea

Sleep often unmasks a sensitive hypocapnic-induced apnoea threshold.

Sleep blunts the ventilatory response to hypercapnea

### Sleep disordered breathing
#### Sleep unmasks a sensitive hypocapnia-induced apnoea

Central sleep apnoea
- Commonly observed in heart failure and some CVD, opiate use and other CNS depressants, Idiopathic, or in the healthy at altitude. 
- Carotid body hyperactivity

### Practical activity
Record <a href="https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT">in the spreadsheet</a> heart rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> before and immediately at the end of the following breath holds. Also record the duration of the breath hold.

Longest breath hold possible following:

1. normal, quiet breathing.

2. a full forced expiration .<br>(Breath out as far as you can, then breath hold.)

3. a full forced inspiration.<br> (Breath in as far as you can, then breath hold.)

4. hyperventilation.<br>(Breathe deeply and forcefully at a rate of about 1 breath/3 seconds, 20 times, then breath hold.)

5. exercise.<br>(30 or more squats.)
