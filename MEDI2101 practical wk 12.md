### Regulation of breathing automaticity by CO<sub>2</sub>
#### Carbon dioxide chemosensation by the brain

Central respiratory chemoreception (CRC) fundamentals.
- Drive to breathe
- Maintains pH within narrow limits

<quote>Blood carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>) as the principal factor that affects the rate and depth of breathing, respiratory sensations, air hunger and breathlessness.</quote>

### Regulation of breathing automaticity by CO<sub>2</sub>
#### Carbon dioxide chemosensation by the brain

<b>Many fundamentals are still unknown.</b>

Central respiratory chemoreception (CRC) is one of the few sensory processes whose molecular and cellular basis remain largely unknown. 
- What is sensed: CO<sub>2</sub> or H<sup>+</sup> ?
- Where is it sensed: glia, neurons? 

Also one of the few sensory processes whose neuronal network and wiring remains unclear.
- How many chemoreceptive nuclei exist in the brain?
- How is breathing regulated by CRC(s)?
- How does peripheral O<sub>2</sub> carotid body chemoreceptors inputs integrate with central pH/pCO<sub>2</sub> respiratory chemoreception?

### Sleep disordered breathing
#### Sleep unmasks a sensitive hypocapnia-induced apnoea

Central sleep apnoea
- Commonly observed in heart failure and some CVD, opiate use and other CNS depressants, idiopathic, or in the healthy at altitude. 
- Carotid body hyperactivity

### Practical activity 1
#### Perform a lung function test

1. Click the FVC button.
2. Get ready with the spirometer.
3. Press the "Start" button.
4. Breathe in deeply, put the spirometer to your mouth and pinching your nose, breath out as hard and fast as possible, pushing, pushing, pushing until you cannot expel any more air.

### Practical activity 2
#### Hypothesise, and test hypothesis, under which condition would have the longeset breath hold
Record <a href="https://bit.ly/2MkvaCT">in the spreadsheet</a> heart rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> before and immediately at the end of the following breath holds. Also record the duration of the breath hold.

Longest breath hold possible following:

1. normal, quiet breathing.

2. a full forced expiration .<br>(Breath out as far as you can, then breath hold.)

3. a full forced inspiration.<br> (Breath in as far as you can, then breath hold.)

4. hyperventilation.<br>(Breathe deeply and forcefully at a rate of about 1 breath/3 seconds, 20 times, then breath hold.)

5. exercise.<br>(30 or more squats.)
